# GettingandCleaningAssignment

This repo includes the required components for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course assignment: 1) an R script that produces the analysis on the wearable computing data; 2) a tidy data produced by the R script (I wrote to a csv file); 3) a codebook describing the calculations and analyses performed in the R script.
